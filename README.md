# ReGlass: Parametric Tool for Sustainable Glass Reuse

**ReGlass** is a parametric tool developed during my bachelor thesis at TU Delft. This project addresses the reuse of naturally aged flat glass to create double-insulated windows, contributing to sustainable practices in construction.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Design**: Adjusts window dimensions dynamically to account for constraints such as thickness, strength, and pre-existing dimensions.
- **Engineering Standards**: Integrates principles from standards like NEN 2608 and NEN-EN 1991 for structural compliance.
- **Sustainability**: Promotes the circular use of glass, reducing environmental impact.

## How to Use
1. **ReGlass.exe**: This is the main application.
2. **icon.ico**: Ensure this file is in the same folder as `ReGlass.exe` to run the application.
3. **ReGlass.py**: Python source code for customization and further development.

## About the Tool
The tool leverages structural and environmental parameters, providing a user-friendly interface for engineers to optimize reused flat glass.

**Note**: While fully operational, the tool requires refinement to address minor computational discrepancies in load distribution between panes.
